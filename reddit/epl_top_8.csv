He just used to come up to me, look at me and not say a word, stand right next to me… 'Oh Jesus, here we go!' 'Just say something to me, have a laugh with me!'  But he was unbelievable at it. He just used to come and stare right into my face, stare right into my eyes, ‘You’re not getting a kick today.'”*    

&nbsp; - Paul Scholes


>*“Your job today is not about touching the ball, it’s not about making passes, your job is Pirlo. That’s all. Pirlo.""*    

&nbsp; - Sir Alex Ferguson


>*“[Sir Alex] is a man without blemish, but he ruined that purity just for a moment when it came to me.  A fleeting shabbiness came over the legend that night. At Milan, he unleashed Park Ji-sung to shadow me.  [Park] rushed about at the speed of an electron. He’d fling himself at me, his hands all over my back, trying to intimidate me.  He’d look at the ball and not know what it was for. They’d programmed him to stop me. His devotion to the task was almost touching. Even though he was a famous player, he consented to being used as a guard dog.""*

&nbsp; - Andrea Pirlo


>*""I’m sure Pirlo woke up the next morning, looked at the bottom of his bed and expected to see Ji-sung Park there.  He was that good.”*

&nbsp; - Rio Ferdinand


>*""Sir Alex Ferguson made me man-mark Pirlo...When he had the ball, I tried to prevent him passing the ball in front of him. To mark Pirlo was not easy. It was hard - mentally and physically - but consequently, Milan had a difficult game against us.""*

lsvvjf6,reddevils,1g84ky1,0.4,I remember an old SAF interview where he said one of his mistakes was in the 2011 CL Final; not playing Park to mark Messi. Otherwise we may have won. I personally don't think so because that Barca team was monstrous. But thoughts?

lspd0wk,reddevils,1g7ccji,-0.5,"Weird how Bayern fans considered him to be the best CB at the club. They signed a petition to keep him. But apparently for Scholes it wasn’t an upgrade. For the money we paid for De Ligt, it was a steal"

ls2b329,reddevils,1g4cch0,0.2,Oof. Some people are not happy. Can’t say I’m ecstatic but I do think it’s good that we save money and he is still clearly going to be a legend forever
ls2bwfm,reddevils,1g4cch0,-0.5,"It’s really not that deep, ffs. Maybe we can just accept that Fergie was the greatest thing to happen to United post-Busby - probably ever - and that he should not be on a multi-million pound role at the club 10 years after retiring?"
ls3qqf2,reddevils,1g4cch0,0.3,"Do Ineos not have PR people?

You get ahead of stuff like this and put out a story first ""SAF mutually agrees to forfeit his 2m a year salary to help the club meet PSR rules"". 

You don't just let it leak and be framed by the media as a soulless corporation sacking the club's biggest legend."

ls2looy,reddevils,1g4cch0,-0.6,"Whatever the thoughts about the removal of his salary, INEOS seem absolutely abysmal at PR. Remove his salary, sure, but keep the title or invent some other role for him. It might all be a placebo, but INEOS were positioning themselves as a fan led enterprise who were going bring the soul back to the club after years of Glazer bloodsucking. It feels like completely the opposite thus far."

lqosmmw,reddevils,1fxshg3,0.8,Legend.
lqouizf,reddevils,1fxshg3,0.9,There were a few seasons where he single handedly carried us. The best shot stopper I've seen in my 20 years of watching football.
lqp3e2t,reddevils,1fxshg3,0.9,"Best Man Utd player of the last ten years or so in my opinion. Can’t believe he has 150 or so clean sheets with a defence that was perpetually in shambles. Super super underrated. One begins to imagine the kind of career he could have had at a competent career. 

Just a little stat for comparison. Ederson in his prem career has averaged 1.67 saves per game, De Gea in his 415 matches has averaged 2.80 saves. Just goes to show.

Petr Cech with more matches has less saves than De Gea. 

Of all the players who got ‘wasted’ at Man Utd over years, I feel the most for De Gea. Man put in performance after performance and saved some of the clearest goals I had ever seen. 

He was genuinely one of the best goalkeepers in the world for that period. Salute David. You shall be remembered."
lqow5fw,reddevils,1fxshg3,1,He was excellent today. Took a pretty sweet hit from Pulisic to deny him his clean sheet. Glad he’s playing again.
lqp3y14,reddevils,1fxshg3,0.9,"From what little I’ve seen he’s adjusted well to life at Fiorentina. Had been their savior for quite a few games too

And he’s just saved two penalties in one game, lol. Happy for him now"

lqwzv9l,LiverpoolFC,1fyucha,1,"Never connected with a manager of our club as much. Probably never will again in my lifetime. His personality, his values, culture, his humour, his aura - everything just fully aligned with everything that our club is about and stands for. Always seemed to say the right things in the right moments, never afraid to say what he thought, criticised when he needed to, stood up for the club, the players, the fans when he needed to and showed passion and empathy by the bucket load. Special, special man. Genuinely forever greatful."

lsvh29n,LiverpoolFC,1g84by8,0.2,"All I’m saying is if Slot was on the verge of losing composure you know something’s up. 100% we’re losing Klopp for 9 games if he was still manager there, he’s sprinting full force at him, teeth grinding, glasses falling off, rage in his eyes and everything.

I’m honestly proud of Nunez for not snapping, I thought for sure he’s gonna flip."

lqgk7i1,LiverpoolFC,1fwr1b1,0.9,"The recent negativity surrounding Endo just shows how short term the memory of a lot of football fans is.

He was literally one of our best players once establishing himself in the team last season. In his first season. In a new club. In a new country. In his 30s. With everyone initially doubting his signing.

What a player. One of my favs, largely for all of the odds he has to constantly overcome."
lqggks7,LiverpoolFC,1fwr1b1,0.9,"He was great when he came on, added a little bit of calm that we really needed. Appreciated his run to the corner flag and him swatting it with his hand for a throw over a goal kick"
lqggrsh,LiverpoolFC,1fwr1b1,0.6,He will get plenty of gametime when we get into the crunch season and players are injured/fatigued all over the shop. Solid player even if he's not in our best 11.
lqgiklf,LiverpoolFC,1fwr1b1,0.6,"Would have preferred him on a little longer, but o think he has a role to play this year. He’s our only destroyer type player we have and has a tidy pass on him"
lqgs43w,LiverpoolFC,1fwr1b1,0.5,I wish Slot trusted him more. We looked so much more stable in the midfield when he came on.

Could have done with Tim Iroegbunam in the middle of the pitch next to Mangala instead of Doucoure and also have Nidaye just in front of them instead of wasted out wide. It's almost like if you're a good footballer, Dyche just doesn't know what to do with you, like Onana. Dyche will only end up ruining the likes of Iroegbunam, Mangala and Nidaye.

ltwn6la,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.9,"Say what you want but this is great for the team. Guys fighting for their place in the squad and the 11 and making the most of their chances.

Very very good for morale and overall competition."
ltxl4gs,Everton,1gcrs8s,1,"First of all, bravo to the OP: this is one of the best headlines I’ve ever read 😊👏🏼 

I’m happy for Beto as his passion has won me over like it has others, and I feel bad for him that Dyche has been stubborn with his system instead of experimenting to make the most of Beto, even if DCL is better overall. Now, if only we could pair Beto’s passion with Dom’s overall game, we’d have a world-beater 😝🤞🏼"
lu4pf72,Everton,1gcrs8s,-0.6,He is so under rated while DCL is so overrated. Dyche is afraid to make bold calls.
ltxpwu0,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.6,Long Live the King!
ltzm8fg,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.5,Would like us to find a way to play two up front with Beto & DCL. Think Keane being up front with Beto helped give their defence something else to think about but when DCL was up front alone he had two defenders on him all the time
lu09wlm,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.3,"I love Beto, but I don't think he has earned the starting spot. He is a fine super sub and a chaos agent against tired defenses. And he has the height to score goals like this one. But just watch him play - he puts in a ton of effort, but his fundamentals aren't there. He misses a lot of easy passes and his control is not good enough to play hold up. He is great to throw on exactly like Dyche did today against a tired team. He ran a ton, and his chaotic challenges and erratic movement actually seemed to work in our favor. He seems unpredictable to play against. Good on him and I hope he continues to make an impact off the bench, but Dom is so much more polished and it's clear. He'll get back into form, he played fine today"
lqeurpp,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.5,"I used to work a Singaporean guy who was an absolutely nuts Newcastle fan. He said it was originally because they went on tour there under Keegan and he’s been a fan ever since. Once he found out I was a Newcastle fan that was that, reeling off stats about Paul Dummett and comparing him to players from the 80s who I’d never even heard of"
lqf9ukx,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.7,"Had a stayover in Singapore about 15 years ago. Taxi driver from the airport to the hotel asked me where I was from - told him the toon. His response:

'Oh! Shearer! Ginola! Ferdinand! DARREN PEACOCK!'"
lqeooq1,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.5,HELLO! Fellow sinkie here!
lqen0gl,NUFC,1fwhc94,1,Glad to see more international fans! Fan from Canada
lqf0fsm,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.6,Great to see! When I was living in Singapore I was at my local hawker and uncle cleaning up dishes was in a 15/16 away kit of all things. Was a breath of fresh air over the sea of Liverpool/Man U strips you usually see.
lqf2hb3,NUFC,1fwhc94,1,What a beautiful family
lqf3fa5,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.5,Reporting in
lqhvnjp,NUFC,1fwhc94,0.2,How’d you get Almiron to pose between you for the photo though?

lpkde80,NUFC,1fsfe7b,0.5,How tall is that fella in the background? Or is it just weird perspective?

lpvl972,NUFC,1ftzag8,0.5,"They got 15k donation from the club and they will get 45% from the gate tonight, I don't think they sell out another ground of our size in the country, they couldn't have got a better draw."
lpvwnjv,NUFC,1ftzag8,-0.7,"I know we go on about being an unlucky lot, but these are supporters who have lost their club to greed, have had their pitch destroyed by a flood, and live 10
miles from Millwall."
lpvxf22,NUFC,1ftzag8,0.5,"They were class tonight. At one point they were giving it ""Sit down if you shag your mum"", which finally got a response out of us lot (i've never heard SJP crowd so quiet)... ""Stand UP if you love the toon"", to which the Wombles applauded warmly."
lpy4aua,NUFC,1ftzag8,1,It’s nice to see such things despite teams being opponents we have to remember we are all fans of football itself
lpykv6d,NUFC,1ftzag8,0.75,"If the attendance was 51,000 and the ticket price was £20, then Wimbledon would receive £459,000 from the gate receipts.

That's a good chunk for a L2 team."
lpz2dnj,NUFC,1ftzag8,-0.6,Rinsed us with their chants mind.
lpvxrqf,NUFC,1ftzag8,-0.7,"As I was leaving the studio I could have sworn they were singing

Premier League


You’re fucking shite


You fucked it up


On a Tuesday night

Despite us beating them, aye the performance wasn’t great but still"
lpvoa82,NUFC,1ftzag8,0.6,Plus we’re so charitable that we only scored one against them

lrujnnn,NUFC,1g2rlcn,0.9,Was there yesterday and Newcastle fans did their team proud. Fantastic noise for their team while Sunderland fans were very quiet.
lrsdy6o,NUFC,1g2rlcn,1,"The attendance at the match was 15,387 which set the record attendance for the Barclays Women’s Championship.  In all reality we might sell out the return fixture.  It’s fantastic!"
lt6xafu,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.6,Hopefully this being sorted is a weight off his mind and a catalyst for him to kick in after a poor start by his standards.
lt6xn2l,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.9,"Great news, hopefully it helps him settle down a bit and we can get the Gordon of last season back."
lt6xx6m,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.5,[club website](https://www.newcastleunited.com/en/news/anthony-gordon-signs-new-long-term-contract)
lt8fp42,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.9,As a newer fan I have been debating which player's shirt I wanted. Gordon it is. Sending winning vibes from the States 🍻
lt73nxz,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.5,I wonder if there is a release clause? I hope not Gordon is unapologetically ambitious and him signing without one would be a super positive signal about the direction of the club
lt7esc5,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.2,"Isak next, please,"
lt70aav,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.8,Great news.
lt74hdg,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.7,Very interesting background for his interview
lt75nxv,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.9,Ahhh finally some good news!!
lt761js,NUFC,1g9lv3o,0.5,he talks about meeting the girl who is sick in his interview - that was done a few weeks ago right? So presumably this contract has been in place for some time..?
