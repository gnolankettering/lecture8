today we're going to show you how to see
transcripts on any
almost youtube video this allows you to
see what the person was saying
especially if you're sometimes i've
known to go too fast it allows you to
back up to actually see the text and
it's pretty accurate so there's two ways
to do it whether you're on a mobile
device or the desktop
what we're going to do is here's a video
over here restore to windows photo
viewer windows 10 by us
and if you're on a mobile device using
the youtube app you're going to look for
the description of the video and over
here to the right somewhere it'll look
differently obviously this is the
desktop there'll be a small arrow you
click on the arrow and you click on
transcript if you're on the desktop
or pc or laptop
come over here to these three dots right
here
and click on show transcript
and it'll come up over here now this is
nice let's say i got to a certain point
in the video
here we are 48 seconds
and
you didn't hit pause i went a little too
fast for you you can see as i move it
the timer moves here
so you can quite easily scroll up a
little bit
say i'm at 48 seconds i missed it what
do you say
go to 45 you can either replay it or
you can catch some of the words right
here
not always 100 accurate but pretty good
so once again it doesn't matter where
you are or
it's another way you can jump forward so
i want to get to two minute point i want
to
get past this and get to the meat of the
video
for example
and again
it's it's not always perfect but it's a
great way to move back and forth on a
video especially if you're doing a
tutorial or maybe a recipe in your
cooking or
learning how to do some plumbing it's a
great way to just stop it read it come
back it's really super easy to do one of
those things people don't notice now
before you do it you may say well
there's nothing here that says show
transcript
when the person uploads a video that can
be disabled it's on by default if the
person disabled it then no it's not
going to be there
i don't know if there's any other
reasons for it not being there in
occasional places i'm assuming maybe not
all languages are supported there's a
ton of languages out there
but most likely most english speaking
videos
with the default upload settings are
going to show you the transcript
and there you have it that's how you can
see transcripts and
pretty much any youtube video out there
thanks for watching as always we
appreciate you
